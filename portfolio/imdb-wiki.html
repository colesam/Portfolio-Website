					    <p>
					    	This project is a web application I built with my partner, Belinda Huang, for our CISC 375 Web Development course at 
					    	the University of St. Thomas.
					    </p>
					    <p>
					    	The project was built using HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, NodeJS, Express, HoganJS, and SQLite 3. It uses a SQLite database our instructor 
					    	created by combining the databases found on <a href="https://www.imdb.com/interfaces/" target="_blank">imdb's website</a>. 
					    	The combined database is available for download <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/gb4uo4x7694vzt8/imdb.sqlite3?dl=0" target="_blank">here</a>.
					    </p>
					    <p>
					    	It should be noted that there were no styling requirements for this project. In order to focus our efforts on the back end, we used the bootstrap 
					    	grid system to handle our layout, and did little custom CSS.
					    </p>

						<h3 class="mb-title">Code I Wrote</h3>
						<p>
							My partner and I both contributed a lot to this project. We also decided that it would be most efficient if we each focused
							on separate parts of the project. This strategy still required a lot of teamwork and communication between us, while allowing us
							to take advantages of our individual strengths.
						</p>
						<p>
							Below you will find an explanation of what parts of the project I focused on, and where to find those parts within the project directory.
						</p>
						<h4>FOLDER STRUCTURE</h4>
						<p>
							I generated the structure of the project using the 
							<a class="link" href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-generator" target="_blank">express-generator</a> module from NPM.
							This set up the structure of the project with express and hoganJS already integrated. 
						</p>
						<h4>VIEWS</h4>
						<p>
							I created all the view templates found in the <a class="link" href="https://github.com/colesam/IMDB-Wiki/tree/master/views?ts=4" target="_blank">root/views</a>
							directory. The exception to this are the people and people-edit templates which were written by my partner, Belinda Huang.
						</p>
						<p>
							Templating was necessary for displaying information on titles and people easily. We simply needed to create a template and then supply that template with
							information from the SQL database. Templates also allowed us to create partial files for the header and footer. This kept the actual templates clear of
							copy and pasted html.
						</p>
						<p>
							I chose to use the HoganJS templating engine for my views because it was very easy to set up with the express-generator. It turned out that it was missing 
							some key features that caused difficulties (see below). If I were to redo the project, I would likely choose a different templating engine.
						</p>
						<h4>ROUTES and DATA</h4>
						<p>
							You will find the routes for the project in the 
							<a class="link" href="https://github.com/colesam/IMDB-Wiki/blob/master/routes/index.js?ts=4" target="_blank">root/routes/index.js</a> directory.
							This allowed us to have more control over where a URL directs a user. I wrote the routes that deal with titles and my partner wrote the routes that
							deal with people. All routes either retrieve or post data to the database. Methods for retrieving or updating data were organized into custom modules, 
							found in the <a class="link" href="https://github.com/colesam/IMDB-Wiki/tree/master/custom_modules?ts=4" target="_blank">root/custom_modules</a> directory. 
						</p>
						<p>
							I also wrote all of the logic for the AJAX routes. These are routes that JQuery code could access in order to load resources asynchronously. For example,
							instead of waiting for the title poster to load before sending the view, I sent the view immediately and then requested the poster from the
							<span class="code">/ajax/titles/posters/:title_id</span> route using JQuery. 
						</p>
						<p>
							An interesting ajax route to look at is the <span class="code">/ajax/cast/:title_id</span> route. This required me to write a separate function,
							<span class="code">data_retriever.getCastFromTitleId()</span>. This was one of the more difficult parts of the project and is outlined
							in the difficulties section below.
						</p>
					<div class="mb-25">
					    <h3 class="mb-title">Difficulties</h3>
					    <h4>GET CAST</h4>
					    <p>
					    	The most difficult part of this project was writing the <span class="code">getCastFromTitleId()</span> function in the get_data.js custom module.
					    	The purpose of this function is to take a title_id and find the cast for that title. Unfortunately, the way the database was set up makes this very difficult.
					    </p>
					    <p>
					    	The database keeps the cast split into two tables, Principals and Crew. There Schemas looked like this:
					    </p>
					    <p>
					    	<span class="code">Principals(tconst, ordering, nconst, category, job, characters)</span>
					    </p>
					    <p>
					    	<span class="code">Crew(tconst, directors, writers)</span>
					    </p>
					    <p>
					    	Principals was very easy to join with the Names database because it had an <span class="code">nconst</span> column that acts as a name id. Crew on the other handle
					    	supplies you with a comma-delimited list of name ids for directors and writers, given a particular title id. To make matters worse, there were duplicates between 
					    	Principals and Crew. For example, sometimes a director was included in Principals and Crew, sometimes only in Principals, and sometimes only in Crew.
					    </p>
					    <p>
					    	I attacked this problem by writing a second helper function <span class="code">getDataByIdArray()</span> inside <span class="code">get_data.js</span>. I would
					    	convert the comma-delimited list of name ids into an array and pass it to this function. The function would return a <span class="code">Promise.all</span> object
					    	that I could use to get an array of rows from the Name table.
					    </p>
					    <p>
					    	By abstracting out the most complicated part of getting the Cast, I was able to clean up my <span class="code">getCastFromTitleId()</span> to only do the following.
					    	First, use a promise to get an array of rows from the Name table that correspond to Principals from the title we are working with. Next, use a promise to get an array
					    	of rows from the Name table that correspond to Crew members. Once both of these promises resolve, combine the two arrays while using name ids to ensure there are no
					    	duplicates.
					    </p>
					    <h4>LOGIC-LESS TEMPLATING</h4>
					    <p>
					    	About half way through the project I realized that there was a major problem with the HoganJS templating engine. The problem was that .hjs templates do not support 
					    	very robust conditional checks. This made doing things like setting default values of form inputs very difficult.
					    </p>
					    <p>
					    	An example of how I overcame this problem can be seen in the 
					    	<a class="link" href="https://github.com/colesam/IMDB-Wiki/blob/master/views/title-edit.hjs" target="_blank">root/views/title-edit.hjs</a> template. The .hjs templates only
					    	support whether or not a variable has been set, but do not support checking if the variable has been set to a particular value.
					    </p>
					    <p>
					    	I wanted to have the genres associated with the title being edited to be pre-selected in the form. Within the <span class="code">/titles/:title_id/edit</span> route,
					    	a video object is passed to the <span class="code">title-edit.hjs</span> view. For each genre associated with this video, I added an attribute to the video object so that
					    	I could set the selected options with the following line within each option element of the select input:
					    </p>
					    <p>
					    	<span class="code">{{#video.Romance}}selected{{/video.Romance}}</span>
					    </p>
					    <p>
					    	This would check if the passed video object had a 'Romance' attribute. If it did, it would set the romance option to selected, solving my logic-less templating issue. In
					    	the future I would choose a different templating engine to avoid having to hack this functionality together.
					    </p>
