					    <p>
							This project is a web application I built using <a class="link" href="https://reactjs.org/" target="_blank">ReactJS</a> and the 
							<a class="link" href="https://developers.google.com/youtube/" target="_blank">YouTube API</a>. The application is a very simple interface for 
							watching YouTube videos. Components load separately from one another resulting in a very fast and clean viewing experience.
					    </p>
					    <p>
							This project was made by following along with Stephen Grider's React course on Udemy. This project differs from Stephen Grider's in styling and some 
							parts of the implementation.

						<h3 class="mb-title">Code I Wrote</h3>
						<h4>React Components</h4>
					    <p>
					    	I wrote the <span class="code">index.js</span> file and ReactJS components found in the 
					    	<a class="link" href="https://github.com/colesam/YouTube-Simple-Viewer/tree/master/src?ts=4" target="_blank">root/src</a> directory. 
					    </p>
					    <p>
					    	Inside <span class="code">index.js</span> you will find the AJAX requests I wrote to the YouTube API. I used 
					    	the <a class="link" href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios" target="_blank" target="_blank">Axios module</a> to make the requests and run
					    	callbacks using its built in promises.
					    </p>
					    <p>
					    	The files in <a href="https://github.com/colesam/YouTube-Simple-Viewer/tree/master/src/components?ts=4" target="_blank">root/src/components</a> 
					    	subdirectory contain primarily html in the form of JSX. The two components that I spent the most time on were 
					    	<a 
					    	class="link" 
					    	href="https://github.com/colesam/YouTube-Simple-Viewer/tree/master/src/components/video_list_item.js?ts=4" 
					    	target="_blank">root/src/components/video_list_item.js</a> 
					    	and
					    	<a 
					    	class="link" 
					    	href="https://github.com/colesam/YouTube-Simple-Viewer/tree/master/src/components/video_detail.js?ts=4" 
					    	target="_blank">root/src/components/video_detail.js</a>.
					    </p>
						<h4>SASS Styling</h4>
						<p>
							I styled this project using the SASS preprocessor. The SASS files and the generated CSS can both be found in the
							<a class="link" href="https://github.com/colesam/YouTube-Simple-Viewer/tree/master/style?ts=4" target="_blank">root/style</a> directory.
						</p>
						<p>
							I styled the UI for this app to be very similar to the way YouTube videos look because the interface is familiar to
							users. It has been simplified to only display search results instead of suggested videos. It also does not display
							any comments or description to keep the interface as clean and "Simple" as possible.
						</p>

					    <h3 class="mb-title">Difficulties</h3>
					    <h4>Setting Selected Video</h4>
					    <p>
					    	The instructor for the course I was following along with would always initialize the selected video to be the first result returned
					    	from a video search. I wanted my application to be able to continue playing even if the videos in the video list were changing due
					    	to a search.
					    </p>
					    <p>
					    	My first solution was to create two functions, one to populate the list of videos and one to load a specific video. I still wanted
					    	to use the first search result as the selected video when the page initializes, but on all subsequent searches I wanted the selected 
					    	video to remain the same.
					    </p>
					    <p>
					    	I quickly realized that I would need to use a promise in the constructor of my App class, because I would not be able to initialize
					    	the selected video until the first search had returned results.
					    </p>
					    <p>
					    	My solution to this problem was to create a single function inside 
					    	the App class in <span class="code">index.js</span>. 
					    </p>
					    <p>
					    	<span class="code">videoSearch( searchTerm, callback )</span>
					    </p>
					    <p>
					    	This function made an AJAX request to YouTube using the searchTerm parameter, 
					    	and then ran the callback parameter if it was provided. I simply provided the following as a callback to the first call to 
					    	<span class="code">videoSearch()</span>:
					    </p>
					    <p>
					    	<span class="code">() => { this.setState({ selectedVideo: this.state.videos[0] }); }</span>
					    </p>
					    <h4>Including Description</h4>
					    <p>
					    	I planned on including an expandable description for the video currently being played only to realize that the YouTube API
					    	returns these descriptions as a string. It's very common for YouTube video descriptions to contain formatted text including
					    	anchor tags and line breaks.
					    </p>
					    <p>
					    	I considered using a regular expression to detect web addresses and convert them to anchor tags, but that would still leave
					    	me with a long block of text unseparated by line breaks. In the end, I decided to put a link to the YouTube video where
					    	the description would have been.
