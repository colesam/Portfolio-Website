# Portfolio-Website
My personal portfolio website for displaying my work to the world 

<h3>Extended Description</h3>
<p>This is my personal portfolio website that I created to show off the projects that I work on. It contains a personal statement, my portfolio items, and a functional contact form.</p> 

<p>I decided to fit it all into a single page so that the user can move between sections quickly without waiting for the page to reload. All navigation items use JQuery to move the user from section to section. I also used JQuery to convert elements styled with vh units to pixels so that the design doesn't break when a mobile user opens a keyboard or changes the orientation of their device.</p>

<p>I continue to improve this site as I learn more about CSS and discover existing bugs.</p>
