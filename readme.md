# Portfolio-Website
My personal portfolio website for displaying my work to the world.

<h3>Extended Description</h3>
<p>This is my personal portfolio website that I created to show off the projects that I am working on. It contains a personal statement, resume, portfolio items, and a functional contact form. The site is hosted at <a href="www.colesamdevelopment.com">www.colesamdevelopment.com</a> and is fully responsive.</p> 

<p>I decided to fit it all into a single page so that the user can move between sections quickly without waiting for the page to reload. All navigation items use JQuery to move the user from section to section. The site was styled using Bootstrap v4.0 but was heavily customized, including creating a new column type for media devices greater than 1500 pixels wide.</p>

<p>I continue to improve this site as I learn more about CSS and discover existing bugs.</p>
