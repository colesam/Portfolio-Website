            Hello my name is Sam Cole and I am a senior studying at the University of St. Thomas in St. Paul, Minnesota. 
            I plan on graduating in May 2018 with a double-major in Computer Science and German. 
            Web Development is something that I have been pursuing outside of my coursework that I want to turn into a career after graduation.
        </p>
        <p>
            I believe that everything on the web should look great, function smoothly, and be so intuitive that my grandmother could figure it out.
            As our lives become more integrated with the Internet, I want to apply my passion for programming and design to make everyday life easier and more enjoyable.
        </p>
        <p>
            Outside of Computer Science I enjoy a few different hobbies like playing piano and guitar, or going backpacking and canoeing in Minnesota's wilderness.
