			As Marketing Chair for the University of St. Thomas Chess Club, one of my responsibilities 
			was to create a logo to be used in university advertisements and on club t-shirts/gear. As 
			the first Marketing Chair for the UST Chess Club, I had to create this logo from scratch using 
			Adobe Illustrator. 
		</p> 
		<p>To create this I used:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Adobe Illustrator CC</li>
		</ul>
