			 This was my first assignment in my CISC-310 Web Development course. The site has two pages, one for keeping track of tasks
			 and another for viewing inspirational images. The site was not allowed to be built using any frameworks and was not required
			 to be responsive to screen size. The full list of specifications can be found on GitHub.
